The BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator app is a helpful tool that allows users to calculate their BMI based on their height and weight. By providing this information and tapping a button, the app instantly computes the BMI value and displays it on the screen. The user can easily see the result and know whether they are "Underweight," "Normal," or "Overweight." The app's straightforward design and quick calculation make it a handy tool for anyone seeking to monitor their health and fitness. With just a few inputs, users can access vital information about their body mass index and make informed decisions about their well-being.
